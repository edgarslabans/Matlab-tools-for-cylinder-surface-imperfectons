# Matlab-tools-for-cylinder-surface-imperfectons
The repository contains two Matlab files for postprosccsing of the point cloud data obtained after geometrical scan of the cylider surface.


my_imperfection_tool.m - tool for plotting of imperfection values in 2D figure

fit_points_to_cyl.m - Matlab code to fit the point cloud to the cylinder geometry returns the file with output of {theta[rad], z[mm] and Imperfection[mm]}
